# If your circumstances change

You can [cancel Marriage Allowance online](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/marriage-allowance-application/history). You’ll be asked to prove your identity using information HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) holds about you.

If you stop transferring the allowance to your partner, it will run until the end of the tax year (5 April).

## If you get divorced or dissolve your civil partnership

You can [cancel the allowance online](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/marriage-allowance-application/history). You’ll be asked to prove your identity using information HMRC holds about you.

If you’re currently transferring your allowance to your partner the change will be backdated to the start of the tax year (6 April).

This might mean your partner underpays their tax for the year. HMRC will tell them how much they owe and usually [collect the tax automatically](https://www.gov.uk/tax-overpayments-and-underpayments/if-you-owe-tax).

## If your income changes

[Contact HMRC](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/income-tax-enquiries-for-individuals-pensioners-and-employees) if your income changes. They’ll tell you if:

- claiming Marriage Allowance will still benefit you as a couple

- you need to cancel your Marriage Allowance

## If your partner dies

If your partner dies after you’ve transferred some of your Personal Allowance to them:

- their estate will be treated as having the increased Personal Allowance

- your Personal Allowance will go back to the normal amount

<div class="callout">

<h3>Example</h3>

Your income is £8,000 and you transferred £1,250 of your allowance to your partner. This made your allowance £11,250 and their allowance £13,750.

After their death, their estate’s Personal Allowance stays at £13,750 and yours goes back to £12,500.
</div>

If your partner transferred some of their Personal Allowance to you before they died:

- your Personal Allowance will remain at the higher level until the end of the tax year (5 April)

- their estate will be treated as having the smaller amount

<div class="callout">

<h3>Example</h3>

Your partner transferred £1,250 to your Personal Allowance, making their allowance £11,250 and yours £13,750.

After their death, your Personal Allowance stays at £13,750 until 5 April, and then goes back to the normal amount. Their estate is treated as having a Personal Allowance of £11,250.
