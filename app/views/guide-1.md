# How it works
Marriage Allowance lets you transfer £1,250 of your [Personal Allowance](/income-tax-rates) to your husband, wife or civil partner.

This reduces their tax by up to £250 in the tax year (6 April to 5 April the next year).

To benefit as a couple, you (as the lower earner) must normally have an income below your Personal Allowance - this is usually £12,500. You can [calculate how much tax you could save as a couple](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/marriage-allowance-application/benefit-calculator/).

If you receive other income, such as dividends, savings or benefits from your job, you should call the [Income Tax helpline](/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/income-tax-enquiries-for-individuals-pensioners-and-employees#marriage-allowance) instead.

You can also call the helpline if you do not know what your taxable income is.

When you transfer some of your Personal Allowance to your husband, wife or civil partner you might have to pay more tax yourself, but you could still pay less as a couple.

<h3>Example</h3>

Your income is £11,500 and your Personal Allowance is £12,500, so you don’t pay tax.

Your partner’s income is £20,000 and their Personal Allowance is £12,500, so they pay tax on £7,500 (their 'taxable income'). This means as a couple you are paying Income Tax on £7,500.

When you claim Marriage Allowance you transfer £1,250 of your Personal Allowance to your partner. Your Personal Allowance becomes £11,250 and your partner gets a 'tax credit' on £1,250 of their taxable income.

This means you will now pay tax on £250, but your partner will only pay tax on £6,250. As a couple you benefit, as you are only paying Income Tax on £6,500 rather than £7,500, which saves you £200 in tax.

## Backdating your claim
You can backdate your claim to include any tax year since 5 April 2015 that you were eligible for Marriage Allowance.

Your partner's tax bill will be reduced depending on the Personal Allowance rate for the years you're backdating.

## If your partner has died since 5 April 2015

You can still claim. Phone the [Income Tax helpline](/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/income-tax-enquiries-for-individuals-pensioners-and-employees#marriage-allowance).

If your partner was the lower earner, the person responsible for managing their tax affairs needs to phone.

## How your partner will receive your Personal Allowance

Your Personal Allowance will transfer automatically to your partner every year until one of you [cancels Marriage Allowance](/marriage-allowance/if-your-circumstances-change) or [your circumstances change](/marriage-allowance/if-your-circumstances-change).
