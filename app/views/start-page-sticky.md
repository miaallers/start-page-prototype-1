Tax your car, motorcycle or other vehicle so you can [drive legally](https://www.gov.uk/legal-obligations-drivers-riders).

You must tax your vehicle even if you do not have to pay anything, for example if [you're exempt](https://www.gov.uk/vehicle-exempt-from-vehicle-tax) because you have a disability.

<div class="callout">

If you’re disabled or your car has been used by a disabled person, you may need to [change your vehicle's tax class](https://www.gov.uk/change-vehicle-tax-class/tax-due-to-run-out-or-changing-if-vehicle-is-exempt).
</div>

You do not need to tax your vehicle if it's [registered as off the road (SORN)](https://www.gov.uk/make-a-sorn).

## What you’ll need

You’ll need a reference number from one of the following:

- a recent reminder (V11) or 'last chance' warning letter from DVLA

- your vehicle log book (V5C) - it must be in your name

- the green ‘new keeper’ slip from a log book if you’ve just bought it

You’ll also need your debit or credit card. You can pay by Direct Debit or in full.

You cannot use the online service if you [use your vehicle for work](https://www.gov.uk/vehicles-you-use-for-work).

### At a Post Office

Go to a [Post Office](http://www.postoffice.co.uk/branch-finder) that deals with vehicle tax.

You need to take either:

- the [payment for your vehicle tax](https://www.gov.uk/vehicle-tax-rate-tables)

- your bank or building society account details to set up a Direct Debit

You will not need these payment details if your [vehicle is exempt from tax](https://www.gov.uk/vehicle-exempt-from-vehicle-tax).

You also need to take one of the following:

- your vehicle log book (V5C) (it must be in your name)

- the green ‘new keeper’ slip from a log book if you’ve just bought it

<div class="callout">

If you do not have any of these documents, you’ll need to [apply for a new log book](https://www.gov.uk//vehicle-log-book).
</div>

You might also need your MOT test certificate (it must be valid when the tax starts).

It can take up to 2 days for MOT information to be updated, so you might not be able to tax your vehicle immediately after it passes its test.

<div class="callout">

In Northern Ireland you also need an insurance certificate or cover note.
