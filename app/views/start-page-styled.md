Tax your car, motorcycle or other vehicle so you can [drive legally](/legal-obligations-drivers-riders).

You must tax your vehicle even if you do not have to pay anything, for example if [you're exempt](/vehicle-exempt-from-vehicle-tax) because you have a disability.

<div class="callout">

If you’re disabled or your car has been used by a disabled person, you may need to [change your vehicle's tax class](/change-vehicle-tax-class/tax-due-to-run-out-or-changing-if-vehicle-is-exempt).
</div>

You do not need to tax your vehicle if it's [registered as off the road (SORN)](/make-a-sorn).

## What you’ll need

You’ll need a reference number from one of the following:

- a recent reminder (V11) or 'last chance' warning letter from DVLA

- your vehicle log book (V5C) - it must be in your name

- the green ‘new keeper’ slip from a log book if you’ve just bought it

You’ll also need your debit or credit card. You can pay by Direct Debit or in full.

## Tax your vehicle online

You cannot use the online service if you [use your vehicle for work](/vehicles-you-use-for-work).

### At a Post Office

Go to a [Post Office](http://www.postoffice.co.uk/branch-finder) that deals with vehicle tax.

You need to take either:

- the [payment for your vehicle tax](/vehicle-tax-rate-tables)

- your bank or building society account details to set up a Direct Debit

You will not need these payment details if your [vehicle is exempt from tax](/vehicle-exempt-from-vehicle-tax).

You also need to take one of the following:

- your vehicle log book (V5C) (it must be in your name)

- the green ‘new keeper’ slip from a log book if you’ve just bought it

<div class="callout">

If you do not have any of these documents, you’ll need to [apply for a new log book](/vehicle-log-book).
</div>

You might also need your MOT test certificate (it must be valid when the tax starts).

It can take up to 2 days for MOT information to be updated, so you might not be able to tax your vehicle immediately after it passes its test.

<div class="callout">

In Northern Ireland you also need an insurance certificate or cover note.
