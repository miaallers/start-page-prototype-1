# Who can apply
You can apply for Marriage Allowance if all the following apply:

- you’re married or in a civil partnership

- you do not pay Income Tax or your income is below your Personal Allowance (usually £12,500)

- your partner pays Income Tax at the [basic rate](/income-tax-rates), which usually means their income is between £12,501 and £50,000 before they receive Marriage Allowance

<div class="callout">

If you're in Scotland, your partner must pay the starter, basic or intermediate rate, which usually means their income is between £12,501 and £43,430.
</div>

Your application for Marriage Allowance will not be affected if you or your partner:

- are currently receiving a pension

- live abroad - as long as you get a [Personal Allowance](/tax-uk-income-live-abroad/personal-allowance)

## Who cannot apply

You cannot claim Marriage Allowance if:

- you're living together, but you're not married or in a civil partnership

- you already get Married Couple’s Allowance

If you or your partner were born before 6 April 1935, you might benefit more as a couple by applying for [Married Couple’s Allowance](/married-couples-allowance) instead.
